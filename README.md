Platform Guides
For those building native apps for iOS and Android (most of you!), each platform has certain features and installation requirements before you can get the most out of your Ionic and Cordova development.

For iOS developers, take a look at the Cordova iOS Platform Guide and follow the instructions to install or upgrade X Code, and possibly register for a developer account to start building apps for iOS.

For Android developers, take a look at the Cordova Android Platform Guide and follow the instructions to install the SDK and/or Android Studio to start building apps for Android.
